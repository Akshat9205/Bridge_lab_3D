🚀 Bridge Lab 3D – Java Learning Journal

Sessions 1–7 :
Welcome to my Java Learning Journal!
Here’s a week-by-week journey of how I started with Git, explored Java fundamentals, and gradually built a strong foundation in programming.

📌 Session 1 – Kicking Off with Git

  > Understood the difference between Git (tool) & GitHub (platform)
  > Explored repositories, branches, merges
  > Practiced the full workflow: commit → push → pull
  > Learned how to track version history & commit messages
  ✨ Takeaway: I can now manage my projects confidently without worrying about losing progress.

⚙️ Session 2 – Inside the Java Machine

  > Explored JVM architecture and its working
  > Understood compiler vs interpreter roles
  > Learned how Garbage Collection keeps memory clean
  ✨ Takeaway: Finally understood what really happens under the hood when Java code runs.

🔤 Session 3 – Back to the Basics

  > Worked with variables, literals & data types
  > Practiced basic I/O
  > Explored operators & type inference (var)
  > Clarified variable scope
  ✨ Takeaway: Built a strong grip on the building blocks of coding.

🔁 Session 4 – Logic & Flow

  > Learned control structures: if/else, switch, loops
  > Practiced for-each loop & transfer statements (break, continue, return)
  > Built a basic calculator app
  ✨ Takeaway: My programs can now decide and repeat like real problem solvers.

📊 Session 5 – Diving into Arrays

  > Practiced 1D, 2D, and multi-dimensional arrays
  > Used java.util.Arrays utilities
  > Tried array copying with System.arraycopy()
  ✨ Takeaway: Arrays gave me a neat way to store & process multiple values.

🧵 Session 6 – Strings & Methods Galore

  Strings:
  > Worked with String, StringBuilder, StringBuffer, StringTokenizer
  > Practiced common methods: length(), charAt(), substring(), etc.
  > Passed strings as parameters
  > Explored ASCII codes
  
  Methods:
  > Created user-defined methods
  > Explored static & library methods
  > Used Math class utilities (Math.random())
  ✨ Takeaway: Strings + methods made my code dynamic, reusable, and powerful.

🏗️ Session 7 – Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

  Understood the 4 pillars of OOP:
  🔒 Encapsulation → bundling data & methods
  🎭 Abstraction → hiding implementation details
  🧬 Inheritance → reusing parent class features
  🔄 Polymorphism → method overloading & overriding
  
  Created classes & objects
  > Worked with constructors (default, parameterized)
  > Used this & super keywords
  > Got introduced to interfaces & abstract classes
  ✨ Takeaway: OOP helps me structure programs like real-world entities—making them modular, reusable, and scalable.

Overall Progress (Sessions 1–7)
✔ Version control with Git
✔ Understood Java internals (JVM & Garbage Collector)
✔ Covered basics → loops → arrays → strings → methods
✔ Stepped into Object-Oriented Programming (classes, objects, OOP pillars)
